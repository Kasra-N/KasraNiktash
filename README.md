# My-Portfolio
## A preview of the website, which is currently live and can be visited at [Kniktash.com](https://kniktash.com/)

This is an early representation of my portfolio website.

Main functions of my portfolio website:

* Display a main page with my name, information and social media
* A bio section which gives a brief description of my past and achievements
* A projects section which would display all of the past and current projects
* A contact section where visitors can directly access my social media and email me either via the cotnact form.

List of things that need to be added in the future:
