# My-Portfolio
## A preview of the website, which is currently live and can be visited at kniktash.com

This is an early representation of my portfolio website.

Main functions of my portfolio website:

* Display a main page with my name, information and social media
* A bio section which gives a brief description of my past and achievements
* A projects section which would display all of the past and current projects
* A contact section where clients can directly access my social media and email me either via the form or their personal email app.

List of things that need to be added in the future:
